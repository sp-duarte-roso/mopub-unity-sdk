2021.1.0
- Added support for transition animations to list items in List views as items are added / removed. See ListExample view for demo.
- Added Navigator view for navigating/switching between views with transition animations. See NavigatorExample view for example how it's used.
- Global values can be defined through the partial class Globals, and they can be accessed in the XML.
  <Label Text="{@GlobalValue}" />
- Added global values for creating responsive UIs: ScreenWidth, ScreenHeight, IsMobile, IsTablet, IsDesktop, IsPortrait, IsLandscape.
- XML values can now be specified in embedded expressions through the notation XML(value):
  <Region Width="$ {@IsPortrait} ? XML(100%) : XML(50%)">
- Framework now allows binding to non-bindable objects i.e. objects that don't inherit from BindableObject or BindableCollection
- Added AdjustToParent enum to all views. Views can now adjust their size to Fill the parent (retaining aspect ratio), Fit inside parent (retaining aspect ratio) or Stretch. 
- Model properties can be assigned to in XML through their Id:
  <MyView Player="Player1" />
  Which translates to MyView.Player = Models.DemoPlayers.Player1
- Color values can now also be defined with 3-digit hex notation: #fff like in css, which duplicates the hexvalues into 6-digits: #ffffff. And the 4-digit notation for #argb -> #aarrggbb. 
- Offsets can now be specified as percentage. Example of offsetting a view 100% of its size to the right:
  <Region Offset="100%,0,0,0" />
